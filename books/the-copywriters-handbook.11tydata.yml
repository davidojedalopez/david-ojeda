Rarely will a headline rate a 3 or 4 on all four U’s. But if your headline doesn’t rate a 3 or 4 on at least three of the U’s, it’s probably not as strong as it could be—and can benefit from some rewriting."

The copywriter creates a picture of what the product can do for the reader, promises the picture will come true if the reader buys the product, proves what the product has done for others, and pushes for immediate action."
  - raw: "Here, then, are twenty-two reasons why people might buy your product. Don’t just read the list; think about each of the reasons and how it might apply to the products you handle. To be liked To be appreciated To be right To feel important To make money To save money To save time To make work easier To be secure To be attractive To be sexy To be comfortable To be distinctive To be happy To have fun To gain knowledge To be healthy To gratify curiosity For convenience Out of fear Out of greed Out of guilt"

    comments:
      - Los features y beneficios no están peleados. Es mala idea solo mostrar los features porque el cliente no se identifica. Es mejor poner lo beneficios porque son más tangibles para el usuario, pero separar el feature y el beneficio con un guión largo en una misma oración cumple los dos propósitos.
