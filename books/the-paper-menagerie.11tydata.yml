- raw: Centillion has put us in little bubbles, where all we see and hear are echoes

    himself into reclaiming my respect and love, instead of facing the reality of
    what he had done and the real me. Perhaps it is the dream of every parent to keep

    from there they strike an imaging surface, be it your retina or a sheet of film
    or a digital sensor, and then they are gone, stopped dead in their paths. If you
    look but don’t pay attention and miss a moment, you cannot travel farther out
    to catch it again. That moment is erased from the universe, forever.
