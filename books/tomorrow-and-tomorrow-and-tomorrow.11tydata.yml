      “Promise me, we won’t ever do this again,” Sadie said. “Promise me, that no
      matter what happens, no matter what dumb thing we supposedly perpetrate on each
      other, we won’t ever go six years without talking to each other. Promise me you’ll
      always forgive me, and I promise I’ll always forgive you.” These, of course, are
      the kinds of vows young people feel comfortable making when they have no idea
      what life has in store for them.

      - 'We''ve all made such promises when we were young and naive. Such as: "I promise I won''t stop looking for each other until the day I die", or "I will love you forever".'
      - We don't ever imagine everything that life has for us, good or bad, and such promises have no support, no solid ground, but they makes us feel at ease and help us navigate the uncertainty of life.

    comments:
      - Going back from Guadalajara to Culiacan sometimes felt like walking backwards.
      - How can I move from a bigger city, where I've lived almost as many years as the town where I grew up, to a way smaller city, with specific cultural issues that I don't like?
      - It felt like a downgrade in many aspects. But in the end, as I thought it would be, it was worth it. Having family around is such a blessing. Seeing my parents more often is comforting, especially as they grow older and older.

      The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to
      know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something
      else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the
      same time.

      “What is a game?” Marx said. “It’s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It’s
      the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you
      keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent,
      ever.”

      “Daedalus, I have found that the most intimate relationships allow for a great
      deal of privacy within them.”
