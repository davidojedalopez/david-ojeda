quotes:
- raw: A piece of writing has to start somewhere, go somewhere, and sit down when
    it gets there. You do that by building what you hope is an unarguable structure.
    Beginning, middle, end. Aristotle, Page 1.
- raw: The lead—like the title—should be a flashlight that shines down into the story.
    A lead is a promise. It promises that the piece of writing is going to be like
    this. If it is not going to be so, don’t use the lead.
