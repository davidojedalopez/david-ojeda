      - ¿Te ha pasado que alguien te cuenta una historia o un logro que hizo y respondes con algo sobre ti? Confieso que lo he hecho, pero cada vez me pasa menos. Me molesta hablar con gente que hace eso. No puedes compartir nada con ellos porque ellos ya lo hicieron anteriormente. O le restan importancia con una historia propia, dejando tu emoción de lado. Antes de salir con tu historia, felicita, pregunta más, alégrate de verdad por la otra persona. Ya tendrás tu turno para hablar.
