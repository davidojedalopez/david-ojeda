- raw: 'how can knowledge of what has not been experienced possibly be ‘derived’ from
    what has? What sort of thinking could possibly constitute a valid derivation of
    the one from the other? No one would expect to deduce the geography of Mars from
    a map of Earth, so why should we expect to be able to learn about physics on Mars
    from experiments done on Earth? Evidently, logical deduction alone would not do,
    because there is a logical gap: no amount of deduction applied to statements describing
    a set of experiences can reach a conclusion about anything other than those experiences.
    The conventional wisdom was that the key is repetition: if one repeatedly has
    similar experiences under similar circumstances, then one is supposed to ‘extrapolate’
    or ‘generalize’ that pattern and predict that it will continue. For instance,
    why do we expect the sun to rise tomorrow morning? Because in the past (so the
    argument goes) we have seen it do so whenever we have looked at the morning sky.'
- raw: As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same
    river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’ So, when
    we remember seeing sunrise ‘repeatedly’ under ‘the same’ circumstances, we are
    tacitly relying on explanatory theories to tell us which combinations of variables
    in our experience we should interpret as being ‘repeated’ phenomena in the underlying
    reality, and which are local or irrelevant.
- raw: 'That is relativism, the doctrine that statements in a given field cannot be
    objectively true or false: at most they can be judged so relative to some cultural
    or other arbitrary standard.'
- raw: if we are simply curious about something, it means that we believe that our
    existing ideas do not adequately capture or explain it. So, we have some criterion
    that our best existing explanation fails to meet. The criterion and the existing
    explanation are conflicting ideas. I shall call a situation in which we experience
    conflicting ideas a problem.
- raw: 'That is what makes good explanations essential to science: it is only when
    a theory is a good explanation – hard to vary – that it even matters whether it
    is testable. Bad explanations are equally useless whether they are testable or
    not.'
- raw: Perhaps it is the mistaken empiricist ideal of ‘pure’, theory-free observation
    that makes it seem odd that truly accurate observation is always so hugely indirect.
- raw: It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality
    when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But
    we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise,
    whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That
    is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments,
    can correct for that deceptiveness. The growth of knowledge consists of correcting
    misconceptions in our theories.
- raw: As the physicist Stephen Hawking put it, humans are ‘just a chemical scum on
    the surface of a typical planet that’s in orbit round a typical star on the outskirts
    of a typical galaxy’.
- raw: The rate at which species have come into existence has on balance only slightly
    exceeded the extinction rate, and the net effect is that the overwhelming majority
    of species that have ever existed on Earth (perhaps 99.9 per cent of them) are
    now extinct.
- raw: Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’
    has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge.
- raw: all vertebrate eyes are filled with liquid water, but water freezes at stratospheric
    temperatures and boils in the vacuum of space.
- raw: That is to say, every putative physical transformation, to be performed in
    a given time with given resources or under any other conditions, is either – impossible
    because it is forbidden by the laws of nature; or – achievable, given the right
    knowledge.
- raw: In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment
    and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created.
- raw: You do not become less of a person if you lose a limb in an accident; it is
    only if you lose your brain that you do. Changing our genes in order to improve
    our lives and to facilitate further improvements is no different in this regard
    from augmenting our skin with clothes or our eyes with telescopes.
- raw: For instance, at present during any given century there is about one chance
    in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough
    to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that
    a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result
    of an astronomical event than a plane crash.
- raw: 'Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed
    unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied
    this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative
    thought. Its other name is death.'
- raw: It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable.
    We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the
    human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none
    of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier.
    So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world
    is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would
    solve them.
- raw: 'We now know that there can be ‘design without a designer’: knowledge without
    a person who created it. Some types of knowledge can be created by evolution.
    I shall come to that shortly. But it is no criticism of Paley that he was unaware
    of a discovery that had yet to be made – one of the greatest discoveries in the
    history of science.'
- raw: A common misconception about Darwinian evolution is that it maximizes ‘the
    good of the species’. That provides a plausible, but false, explanation of apparently
    altruistic behaviour in nature, such as parents risking their lives to protect
    their young, or the strongest animals going to the perimeter of a herd under attack
    – thereby decreasing their own chances of having a long and pleasant life or further
    offspring. Thus, it is said, evolution optimizes the good of the species, not
    the individual. But, in reality, evolution optimizes neither.
- raw: If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the
    species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents
    that.
- raw: 'Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene
    because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’
    of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote
    the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers,
    nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population
    at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.'
