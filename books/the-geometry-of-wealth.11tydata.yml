quotes:
- raw: Being rich is having “more.” The push for more is a treadmill on which satisfaction
    is typically fleeting. The quest to be rich usually doesn’t end where many of
    its sojourners think it will. Wealth, by contrast, is funded contentment. It is
    the ability to underwrite a meaningful life—however one chooses to define that.
- raw: No matter the lifestyle, accent, politics, or favorite sports team, everyone
    I meet wants to take care of their families, remain or get healthy, be generous
    to others, enjoy their hobbies, and excel at work.
- raw: If anything, money alleviates sadness more than it inspires joy.
- raw: 'Crosby suggests three major reasons that we loathe talking about money: It’s
    stressful, it’s socially taboo, and most of us are uneasy with numbers. He cites
    a 2004 American Psychological Association survey showing that 73% of Americans
    say money is the most stressful factor in life. It is more stressful than death,
    politics, or religion.'
- raw: We don’t sprint to Target when they mark up all of their merchandise and avoid
    the mall when everything goes on sale. But that’s exactly how the investment community
    in aggregate acts.
- raw: Only a small portion of our contentment in life—about 10%—is determined by
    life’s circumstances. Ponder the gravity of that insight for a moment. The attributes
    many of us often use to define ourselves are only incidental to living well. Whether
    you live on a country estate or in a one-bedroom flat; whether you have perfect
    features or are a strong candidate for plastic surgery; whether you enjoy family
    bliss or endured nasty divorce; whether you are at the top of your class or are
    an unrepentant slacker. These and countless other examples have only a slight
    impact on our lifelong happiness.
- raw: In life, we begin just once, but we begin again countless times. Resilience
    is where many great things are born. Adaptation recognizes the need to respond
    to life’s events, including those which are unforeseen and unwanted. To use Wilson’s
    felicitous phrase, it is “changing the stories we live by.”
- raw: “Wherever you fly, you’ll be best of the best. Wherever you go, you will top
    all the rest. Except when you don’t. Because, sometimes, you won’t. You’ll get
    mixed up, of course, as you already know. You’ll get mixed up with many strange
    birds as you go. So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact and remember
    that Life’s a Great Balancing Act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.
    And never mix up your right foot with your left.” Seuss’ deceptively elementary
    book lays bare in just 340 words life’s journey of ups and downs, decisions good
    and bad.
- raw: While happiness (what I refer to as experienced happiness) comes and goes with
    daily pleasures, the achievement of joy (reflective happiness) takes work.
- raw: But work means something more than a pay check. What we “do” in life is a deep
    source of meaning. It defines us. (What’s the first question you usually get asked
    when meeting a stranger?) Being good at something you care about is one of life’s
    most profound sources of fulfilment. When we can exercise our craft, excel at
    it, and see that it has a positive impact on the world around us, it feels good.
- raw: Work doesn’t become meaningful without some sense of struggle, without genuine
    effort.
- raw: Money is more effective at diminishing sadness than increasing happiness.
- raw: In particular, there is emerging evidence that a higher income may have more
    of an impact on lessening sadness than increasing happiness.
- raw: Happiness follows a serpentine path through our money lives. Having more money
    can buy daily happiness, but only so much and for only so long. The hedonic treadmill
    is unavoidable. Equally if not more profound, having more money can alleviate
    the pain and distraction of sadness. That’s valuable in both the obvious sense,
    but also in that by sidestepping misfortune we preserve the mental energy to engage
    in more contemplative pursuits.
- raw: 'What drove Pascal, just like it does us, is what modern behaviorists call
    “loss aversion.” This is the simple but powerful idea that the pain of losses
    is greater than the pleasure of gains. We are wired this way: Our brains emphasize
    avoiding losses over achieving gains.'
- raw: Loss aversion has no “off” switch. It’s always on, animating one of life’s
    endless tensions. We want great things, but the disproportionate impact of losses
    holds us back. We are both aspirational and scared, greedy and fearful. We like
    risk, we just don’t like losses. Broadly speaking, in life successfully managing
    the daily balance between risk seeking and risk aversion is the first key to wealth.
- raw: Taking more risk does not produce greater returns. Instead, taking more risk
    increases the variability of future outcomes. That’s not great bumper sticker
    material. Nevertheless, if there were a reliable relationship between more risk
    and bigger rewards, then technically you wouldn’t be taking more risk. Everyone
    would bet long shots all the time.
- raw: Not losing is the first step toward winning.
- raw: In tennis, like investing, professionals strive to be more right, while most
    others should focus on being less wrong.
- raw: “People may believe that who they are today is pretty much who they will be
    tomorrow, despite the fact that it isn’t who they were yesterday.”
- raw: But overly specific long-term plans can cause problems, too. How sure are we
    that in a decade or two we will want that vacation home in Florida, that boat,
    or that high-rise apartment in the city? As I’ve pointed out, we’re pretty poor
    at predicting what we want in the future. We assume that what we prefer now is
    what we’ll prefer far down the road, that our values will go unchanged—and that
    life’s unpredictable events won’t upend our assumptions.
- raw: First, we prioritize being “less wrong” over being “more right.” Managing risk
    is a priority over enhancing returns. This risk-first mindset flies in the face
    of most elements of the modern money culture. It also happens to be the hallmark
    of history’s greatest investors. It is how we protect ourselves and stay in the
    game.
- raw: Second, we immunize our liabilities before we maximize our assets. Much of
    financial advice remains focused on choosing great investments or even “beating
    the market.” Instead, our priority is taking care of obligations—no matter how
    hard they are to define, especially far in the future.
- raw: Finally, successful investing starts by looking in the mirror. It is undermined
    by looking out the window or by staring at financial television. The vagaries
    of psychology trump the precisions of finance over time.
- raw: For investing purposes, what something does is more important than what it
    is. An official definition of an asset class, as cited above, is a group of securities
    that exhibit similar characteristics and behave similarly, but witness how even
    a formal definition conflates attribute and function. Sometimes things that look
    the same don’t behave the same. Conversely, different-looking investments can
    behave similarly.
- raw: Striving for decent outcomes is as good and honest an effort as we can make.
    It’s also the easier path. Our mental energy is limited. Adaptive simplicity’s
    tank can run to empty, at which point complexity and impulsiveness are more likely
    to wreak havoc.
- raw: 'There are four—and only four—quantitative elements that enlighten any potential
    investment.159 These are, to use the technical terms: Returns, volatility, correlation,
    and liquidity.'
- raw: Remember, successful investing is based more on minimizing regret than maximizing
    gains.
- raw: 'The well-worn notion that taking more risk produces more return is inaccurate.
    Instead, taking more risk increases the range of potential outcomes:'
- raw: Volatility is the “price of admission” for access to potential gains.
- raw: Investors have become conditioned to believe that they want to own a diversified
    portfolio, but they often don’t like the reality of diversification. Like vegetables,
    diversification sounds healthy but doesn’t always taste good. With true diversification,
    there will always be something in your portfolio that stinks.
- raw: Money will always inform our sense of self-worth and place in the world. Having
    more—especially more than others—is psychologically meaningful. To think otherwise
    would be naïve.
- raw: One tack for realizing the upside of managed anticipation is to pay now but
    consume later.195 There’s something stodgy-sounding about the “layaway” plans
    of yesteryear, but that pay now/consume later is a better recipe for happiness
    than the consume now/pay later regime of the modern credit card.
- raw: True wealth is funded contentment. Anyone with the right mindset and the right
    plan can afford a meaningful life.
- raw: Does money buy happiness? The answer to this timeless question hinges on the
    distinction between being rich and being wealthy. One is the quest for more money,
    the other is funded contentment.
- raw: money is more effective at alleviating sadness than priming happiness, which
    explains why the rich might be less sad but not happier than others.
