    <p>My name is <b>David Ojeda L√≥pez</b>, but people call me <b>El Perro</b> (don't be shy). I currently live in Zapopan, Jalisco, M√©xico and work at <a href="https://www.handy.la" target="_blank">Handy</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm a web developer, mainly on the back-end side of things. I also specialize myself on DevOps based on <span class="amazon-orange"><b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b></span>. I'm always learning new stuff, specially related to new AWS services and features.</p>
    <p>On the back-end side I work with Grails and micro-services on Node. On the front-side I've used the usual HTML, CSS, SASS and JS, but combined with Webpack, AWS S3 and AWS CloudFront.</p>
    <p>Outside the developer's world, I'm an <b>Overwatch</b> amateur player (mid/high diamond). My BattleTag is <b>#MEXshredder:2830</b>, in case you want to have some fun.</p>
    <p>On december 2017 I ran my <b>first and only half-marathon</b>, but now I only run 5km races and lift weights at the gym.</p>
    <p>I'm available for any programming or professional guidance inquiries. I may not have the largest nor greatest experience on the field, but I'll do my best to help.</p>
