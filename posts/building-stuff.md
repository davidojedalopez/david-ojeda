I have way more content to share when I'm doing stuff in real-life.

My most inspiring moments come when I'm actively building and creating a project of my own. And that inspiration usually leads to better articles, tweets, and newsletters.

The days I struggle the most when trying to create content are those days in which my projects are either paused or dead.

So, this is a small self-reminder to keep building stuff and sharing what I learn and struggle with along the way.
