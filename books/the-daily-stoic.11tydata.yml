quotes:
  - raw: "The philosophy asserts that virtue (meaning, chiefly, the four cardinal virtues of self-control, courage, justice, and wisdom) is happiness, and it is our perceptions of things—rather than the things themselves—that cause most of our trouble."
  - raw: "The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t."
  - raw: "If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle."
  - raw: "BE RUTHLESS TO THE THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER"
  - raw: "the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do."
  - raw: "Control your perceptions. Direct your actions properly. Willingly accept what’s outside your control."

  - raw: "Epictetus is reminding you that serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment. If you seek to avoid all disruptions to tranquility—other people, external events, stress—you will never be successful. Your problems will follow you wherever you run and hide. But if you seek to avoid the harmful and disruptive judgments that cause those problems, then you will be stable and steady wherever you happen to be."
  - raw: "This morning, remind yourself of what is in your control and what’s not in your control. Remind yourself to focus on the former and not the latter. Before lunch, remind yourself that the only thing you truly possess is your ability to make choices (and to use reason and judgment when doing so)."
  - raw: "In the afternoon, remind yourself that aside from the choices you make, your fate is not entirely up to you."
  - raw: "remember what is inside our control. According to the Stoics, the circle of control contains just one thing: YOUR MIND."

  - raw: "“I have the power within me to keep that out. I can see the truth.”"
  - raw: "“If you wish to improve, be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters—don’t wish to seem knowledgeable. And if some regard you as important, distrust yourself.”"
  - raw: "The busier we get, the more we work and learn and read, the further we may drift."

  - raw: "“We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not let it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power to shape our judgments.”"
    comments:

  - raw: "It’s making sure that your mind is in charge, not your emotions, not your immediate physical sensations, not your surging hormones."

  - raw: "“It is the privilege of the gods to want nothing, and of godlike men to want little.”"
  - raw: "Our reaction is what actually decides whether harm has occurred."

  - raw: "“No slavery is more disgraceful,” he quipped, “than one which is self-imposed.”"
  - raw: "Listen and connect with people, don’t perform for them."
  - raw: "because our senses are often wrong, our emotions overly alarmed, our projections overly optimistic, we’re better off not rushing into conclusions about anything."
  - raw: "“Above all, keep a close watch on this—that you are never so tied to your former acquaintances and friends that you are pulled down to their level. If you don’t, you’ll be ruined. . . . You must choose whether to be loved by these friends and remain the same person, or to become a better person at the cost of those friends . . . if you try to have it both ways you will neither make progress nor keep what you once had.”"

  - raw: "We can’t blame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us. They’re just the target."

  - raw: "Choose the right inference from someone’s actions or from external events, and it’s a lot more likely that you’ll have the right response."
  - raw: "But what if we let these opinions go? Let’s try weeding (ekkoptein; cutting or knocking out) them out of our lives so that things simply are. Not good or bad, not colored with opinion or judgment. Just are."

    comments:
      - Es muy fácil dejarse llevar y hablar de más. Pero lo que deberíamos hacer es escuchar más, y hablar menos. Para eso tenemos dos orejas y solo una boca.

  - raw: "Those who pick things up quickly are notorious for skipping the basic lessons and ignoring the fundamentals. Don’t get carried away. Take it slow. Train with humility."
  - raw: "“Whenever you have trouble getting up in the morning, remind yourself that you’ve been made by nature for the purpose of working with others, whereas even unthinking animals share sleeping. And it’s our own natural purpose that is more fitting and more satisfying.”"

  - raw: "The proper response of the Stoic to these events is not to not care, but mindless, meaningless sympathy does very little either (and comes at the cost of one’s own serenity, in most cases). If there is something you can actually do to help these suffering people, then, yes, the disturbing news (and your reaction to it) has relevance to your reasoned choice. If emoting is the end of your participation, then you ought to get back to your own individual duty—to yourself, to your family, to your country."

  - raw: "Silence is a way to build strength and self-sufficiency."
  - raw: "“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”"
  - raw: "If you give things more time and energy than they deserve, they’re no longer lesser things. You’ve made them important by the life you’ve spent on them. And sadly, you’ve made the important things—your family, your health, your true commitments—less so as a result of what you’ve stolen from them."
    comments:
      - Tú decides qué cosas son importantes al dedicarles tiempo. Si pasas tu tiempo envuelto en discusiones sin sentido, las estás haciendo importantes.
      - Al hacer importante algo que no vale la pena, estás haciendo menos importante algo que sí lo vale, como tu familia, salud, amigos y verdaderas obligaciones.
  - raw: "If you find yourself trying to persuade someone to change or do something differently, remember what an effective lever self-interest is. It’s not that this or that is bad, it’s that it is in their best interest to do it a different way. And show them—don’t moralize."

  - raw: "The point is not to have an iron will, but an adaptable will—a will that makes full use of reason to clarify perception, impulse, and judgment to act effectively for the right purpose."
  - raw: "You can always get up after you fall, but remember, what has been said can never be unsaid. Especially cruel and hurtful things."
  - raw: "If you say you’re being honest now, does that mean you usually aren’t?"
    comments:
      - No me gusta usar la frase "para serte sincero" porque me hace pensar que en otras ocasiones no fui sincero. Puede que mucha gente no lo vea así, porque se ha convertido en una forma muy común de iniciar una idea y "ganar" la confianza de la otra persona.
  - raw: "If you see someone who is in need of help, or has asked for guidance, provide it. You owe them that much."
  - raw: "Let’s not confuse getting better at stuff with being a better person. One is a much bigger priority than the other."
  - raw: "That’s it. That’s what goes into the most important skill of all: how to live."
  - raw: "These three parts—the moral, the natural, and the rational—have one aim. As different as they are, they have the same purpose: to help you live a good life ruled by reason."

      - No necesitas dar explicaciones a extraños en el internet. Si no están de acuerdo con lo que haces o dices, y no ves que se pueda entablar una conversación sana y educada, lo mejor es no explicarte. Cuando lo haces te estás rebajando de nivel, y ellos están subiendo. Repentinamente les das mucha más importancia de lo que podrían merecer. Claro que vale la pena dar explicaciones a personas cercanas o cuando estás consciente de que hiciste algo mal.

  - raw: "It’s not about overcoming our fears but understanding that both hope and fear contain a dangerous amount of want and worry in them."
  - raw: "1. Accept only what is true.  2. Work for the common good.  3. Match our needs and wants with what is in our control.  4. Embrace what nature has in store for us."
  - raw: "“In short, you must remember this—that if you hold anything dear outside of your own reasoned choice, you will have destroyed your capacity for choice.”"
  - raw: "our attachments are what make it so hard to accept change."
