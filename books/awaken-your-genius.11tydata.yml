      We say that some people march to the beat of a different drummer. But implicit
      in this cliché is that the rest of us march to the same beat. This is true to
      a disturbing extent. We’re told from an early age not to cause a ruckus, to do
      what it takes to fit in without looking like we’re trying.

      schools end up unteaching creativity. Kids unlearn how to make art, they unlearn
      how to speak up, and they unlearn how to take initiative and ask critical questions.
      They are rewarded for thinking like the teacher, thinking like the school board,
      or thinking like the textbook author—not for thinking for themselves or questioning
      what they learn.

      - Desde hace tiempo pienso que el sistema educativo tradicional está roto, pero me parece que sería muy difícil cambiarlo radicalmente, por lo que mis hijos probablemente tengan que pasar por él, así como yo lo hice. La diferencia que puedo hacer está en desarrollar las habilidades que el sistema actual no desarrolla, o que incluso evita fomentar.

      "A typical question in this game of “Let’s pretend” might be “Who discovered
      America?” A question like this closes off all inquiry by demanding a one-dimensional,
      Eurocentric answer like “Christopher Columbus.” Yet a far more interesting question
      is, “How do you discover who discovered America?”11 That question leads to even
      more questions: “What does ‘discover’ mean?” “Weren’t there millions of people
      already living in America when the Europeans arrived?” “Were the native people
      always here?” “If not, how did they arrive? By foot? By boat? From where?” “Where
      would you look to find out?” These questions—which defy simple answers—are the
      types of questions that students will encounter in real life. Students leave school
      perfectly equipped to thrive in a world that doesn’t exist outside the classroom.
      They feel lost because, in life, there are no clearly defined problems with a
      single, clearly defined solution."

      - Conforme más avanzo en el trabajo, más raro es encontrar preguntas fáciles que tienen una sola respuesta. Usualmente las preguntas son abiertas, y cada pregunta abre la puerta para muchas preguntas más. Y las respuestas a esas preguntas suelen ser un "depende", porque todo en esta vida es un tradeoff (intercambio).

      So let’s stop asking, “What did you learn in school today?” That question perpetuates
      the outdated conception of education as an endeavor whose only purpose is to teach
      students the right answers. Instead, let’s ask, “What made you curious today?”
      or “What questions are you interested in exploring?” or “How would you figure
      out the answers?” or any other question designed to get students to think for
      themselves and to put a question mark at the end of conventional wisdom.

      “Every child is an artist,” Pablo Picasso purportedly said. “The problem is
      how to remain an artist once he grows up.”13 As student loans and mortgages begin
      to mount, we get stuck in old patterns and lose sight of the artist within. Our
      vocabulary reflects this shift. We don’t even call it “art” anymore. We call it
      “content.” A part of me dies inside when someone calls themselves a “content creator.”
      Content is something you stuff inside a bag. It’s something you produce on an
      assembly line. No one wants to get up in the morning and read content over coffee.
      And no truly self-respecting creator wants to generate content either. Because
      content is normal. Content is fungible. Content creators can be replaced. Artists
      can’t.
    comments:
      - Nunca me ha convencido el término de creador de contenido tampoco, pero nunca había encontrado una mejor forma de llamarlo. Empezaré a llamar arte todo lo que escribo, programo, y comparto, al menos a todo lo que considero interesante.

      Art isn’t just related to objects. As long as you’re reimagining the status

      The fewer labels that follow “I am…,” the more freedom you have to step into

      shackles that remind you who you are, who others think you are,” as Rebecca Solnit

      "Here’s an unusual way to implement this curiosity-over-victory mindset. When
      you’re about to disagree with someone, don’t say anything until after you’ve restated
      what the other person has said to that person’s satisfaction.8 And that person,
      in turn, can’t respond to you until they restate what you said to your satisfaction.
      This rule disrupts the typical social dynamic where you’re so focused on crafting
      your own clever retort that you stop paying attention to the other person. Try
      it out in your next work meeting or contentious conversation. And remember Haruki
      Murakami’s advice: “To argue, and win, is to break down the reality of the person
      you are arguing against. It is painful to lose your reality, so be kind, even
      if you are right.”"

      1. Don’t blend ideas into your identity. Write your opinions in temporary ink
      so they can be revised. Instead of saying, “This is what I believe,” say, “This

      ideas and opinions—just like ourselves—are works in progress, continually changing
      and improving. “‘What I believe’ is a process rather than a finality,” as Emma

      my mind might be changing—and that’s a good thing for a mind to do from time to

      moment and intentionally give your full attention to what you’ll do next, you’ll
      trigger an internal defibrillator that can jolt you back to life and bring you
      closer to your full capacity. It’s like the way a great leader might shake your

      I spent much of middle school assuming that I was missing some belonging chip

      sense—or even basic color coordination—didn’t come naturally to me. I had an admittedly
      lowbrow taste in music and preferred the catchy tunes of Ace of Base over the
      infinitely more popular Nirvana.

      Trying to fit in makes it harder to belong. As Brené Brown describes it, “Belonging

      Becoming extraordinary requires becoming more like yourself. When you do that,
      you become a magnet that attracts some people with the same force that repels
      others. You can’t be liked by all and disliked by none. If you aim for that unachievable
      objective, you’ll only reduce the force of your magnet—the very source of your
      strength. The only way to attract people who like purple is to show your purple.

      Regaining control requires being intentional about what you do, instead of

      Here are some questions to consider. What makes you you? What are some of the

      "We’re taught to show only one part of ourselves—one dimension, one personality,
      and one profession. Hence the cliché questions, “What will you be when you grow
      up?” or “What do you do for a living?” The underlying implication is clear: You
      are defined by what you do—you’re a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer—and what
      you do is a single, static thing. If your identity is bound up with your profession,
      what happens if you lose your job—or decide you don’t want to do it anymore? What
      happens when that specialty you’ve spent a lifetime perfecting becomes obsolete?"

      The only escape, the only path to genuine resilience, is through diversity.
      Treat yourself like your financial investments and hedge your bets. Once you’ve
      figured out your first principles, mix and remix them. Pursue multiple interests.
      Diversify yourself. If you have a diversity of traits and skills that you can
      recombine and repurpose, you’ll enjoy an extraordinary advantage to evolve with
      the future.

      When diversifying, the more unusual the combination, the greater the potential
      value. It’s certainly helpful for a singer to learn to dance, but there’s nothing
      distinct or unusual in that mix. Rarer combinations, however, lead to unexpected
      benefits. A doctor who can code. A contractor with a flair for public speaking.
      An engineer who knows the law. A football player who performs ballet, as Heisman

      To figure out what brings you alive and what leaves you depleted, keep an energy
      journal. Track when you feel engaged and enthusiastic—and when you feel bored
      and restless. Follow the subtle signals from your body—when it relaxes and expands,
      when it tightens and contracts. The more specific your observations, the better

      Thinking for yourself isn’t just about reducing external inputs, in the ways
      that I described in the Detox chapter. It’s about making thought a deliberate

      Confirmation bias often looks like scientific data collection. But instead

      Instead of asking, “Does anyone have any questions?,” I began to say, “I’ll
      now take your questions,” or even better, “The material we just covered was confusing,
      and I’m confident there are plenty of you with questions. This is a great time
      to ask them.” The number of hands that went up increased dramatically.

      "If you ask a team member, “Are you facing any challenges?,” most will say
      no. They might fear that their admission will be seen as a weakness. You’re more
      likely to get an honest response if you ask: “What challenges are you facing right
      now?” That question presumes that challenges are the norm, not the exception."

      "Werner Heisenberg, the brains behind the uncertainty principle in quantum
      mechanics, had it right: “What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed
      to our method of questioning.”34 When we reframe a question—when we change our
      method of questioning—we also change the outcome."

      We often don’t even have to decide what to consume next. Our streaming services
      take that burden off our shoulders by automatically queuing up a new show that
      the algorithms think we’ll love. Hello, Indian Matchmaking. These algorithms don’t
      care about quality. They only care about your attention—getting it and retaining
      it.

      But popular doesn’t mean better. Popular simply means the majority prefers
      that thing over something else. In many cases, it’s not even the majority that
      determines what’s popular. Publishers predetermine which books have a good chance
      of success before they hit the stands, spend marketing dollars on those books,
      and make sure they’re displayed front and center in your local bookstore.

      To paraphrase Haruki Murakami, if you consume what everyone else is consuming,
      you’ll think what everyone else is thinking.

      Looking backward also means rereading books you’ve read in the past. Rereading
      is not a waste of time. Every time I return to a book, it’s a new person reading
      it. The book hasn’t changed. But I have changed. I pick up on subtleties that
      I missed the first time around, and ideas become relevant because of where I am
      now in life.

      In fact, the more unique your life is, the more comparison loses its meaning.
      If you crave what others also crave, you’re more likely to get caught up in a
      rat race.
