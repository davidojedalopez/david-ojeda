quotes:
- raw: And in that moment, the moment of the crash, it made me realize that monsters
    don’t hide in the woods; they aren’t shadows in the trees or invisible things
    lurking in darkened corners. No, the real monsters move in plain sight.
- raw: I understand the way the brain can fundamentally fuck with every other aspect
    of your body; the way your emotions can distort things—emotions you didn’t even
    know you had. The way those emotions can make it impossible to see clearly, think
    clearly, do anything clearly. The way they can make you hurt from your head down
    to your fingertips, a dull, throbbing, constant pain that never goes away.
- raw: On the one hand, my father had taught me that it’s entirely possible to love
    someone without ever really knowing them, and that thought kept me up at night.
- raw: I remember that statistic I learned in school, the one that made my blood run
    cold—forty percent of people who are abused as children will go on to become abusers
    themselves. It doesn’t happen to everyone, but it happens. It’s cyclical. It’s
    about power, control—or rather, the lack of control. It’s about taking it back
    and claiming it as your own.
- raw: 'It wasn’t until I found myself hovering over Cooper in my kitchen, looking
    down at his weakened body, that I had a taste of what it really felt like: control.
    Of not only having it, but taking it from somebody else. Snatching it up and claiming
    it as your own. And for one single moment, like a flicker in the dark, it felt
    good.'
