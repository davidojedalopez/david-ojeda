  - raw: "Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.

It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent."
  - raw: "Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations."
  - raw: "Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits.

It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed."
  - raw: "“When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.

      - Es muy fácil lograr tus objetivos cuando estás motivado. Por ejemplo, es más fácil ir al gimnasio al empezar el año porque estás motivado por un año nuevo, tienes propósitos que cumplir. Y muchas otras personas piensan igual que tú, por eso los gimnasios están hasta su madre desde enero a marzo. Son pocos los que continúan después de esas fechas, pero son ellos quienes siguieron sus hábitos a pesar de no estar siempre motivados.
