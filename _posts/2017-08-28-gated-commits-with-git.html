<p>A gated commit, also called a <strong>pre-tested</strong> commit, is an integration pattern in which a commit is not approved until a set of tests are ran against the code being commited. In other words, the commit does not go through if the test suite fails.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you want this?</strong> It makes your application more resilient to change since now you are running a set or sub-set of your tests even before that code is available to anyone else.</p>

<p>I am going to show you how to implement a gated commit pattern with Git. In this example, our <strong>unit test suite</strong> will be the <em>gate</em> to allow our commits to make it to the codebase.</p>

<h2>What do you need?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Git</li>
    <li>Your application's Git repo</li>
    <li>A test suite</li>
</ul>

<h3>Starting off: Git Hooks</h3>

<p>We want our tests to run before a commit goes through. Git allows us to run custom commands just before that event happens thanks to Git hooks. I am not going to go into the details on how they work, but conveniently for us, there is a hook called <strong>pre-commit</strong>. This hook is executed just before the commit happens. Perfect spot for our test suite to run.</p>

<h3>Setting up a pre-commit hook</h3>

<p>There is a folder named .git in which the hooks are stored. If you have never modified any hook, your .git directory structure will look like this:</p>

<img src="/assets/gated-commits-with-git/git-tree-dir.png" class="img-centered"/>

<br><br>

<p>To create our hook, we need to have a file called <strong>pre-commit</strong> (no extension required) inside our <strong>hooks</strong> directory. Let's create it. The only thing the file needs to have is the command you use to run your tests. </p>

<p>If your application is, let's say, a Ruby application, you probably run your tests using <strong>rake</strong>. If that's the case, your <strong>pre-commit</strong> file will look like this:</p>

<code>rake test:units</code>

<br><br>

<p>Or if you are into the JS hype, you can probably have this in your file:</p>

<code>npm tests</code>
<br><br>

<p>Independently of the language/framework you are using, your pre-commit hook needs to have the command to run your unit test suite. And, as long as the code inside the hook returns a <strong>zero exit code</strong>, the hook will allow the code to be commited. Otherwise, the commit will be rejected.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>At this point you can go ahead and make a commit and see how our tests are run (and hopefully pass), thus opening the gate and letting the commit pass uncontested.</p>

<p>In the following example I am using a Grails application, and the pre-commit hook contains the following code:</p>

<code>grails test-app -unit</code>

<h4 class="text-center">
    <strong>SUCCESS!</strong> üéâ
</h4>

<p>In the case that the test suite fails:</p>
<img src="/assets/gated-commits-with-git/no-loop-pre-commit-hook-test-fail.gif" onclick="this.src = this.src" class="img-centered"/>

<h4 class="text-center">Sad face ‚òπÔ∏è</h4>

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>

<p>We have just created a Git pre-commit hook that contains specific commands to execute our app's unit test suite. <strong>Whenever a commit is issued</strong>, our tests run. If tests pass, we have a successful commit, if not, commit is rejected</p>

<p>You can extend your tests of the pre-commit hook and build something <strong>as complex as you need</strong>. You can, for example, run a linter tool to make sure style guidelines are being followed. Or take it to the next level and integrate it with your Continuous Integration flow using additional hooks.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you build more resilience into your codebase and, ultimately, deliver more value to your customers in a <strong>safe and rapid</strong> fashion!</p>
