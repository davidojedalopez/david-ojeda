quotes:
- raw: The workings of a complicated device like an internal combustion engine might
    be confusing, but they ultimately can be broken down into a series of neat and
    tidy deterministic relationships; by the end, you will be able to predict with
    relative certainty what will happen when one part of the device is activated or
    altered. Complexity, on the other hand, occurs when the number of interactions
    between components increases dramatically—the interdependencies that allow viruses
    and bank runs to spread; this is where things quickly become unpredictable.
- raw: treating an ecosystem as though it were a machine with predictable trajectories
    from input to output is a dangerous folly.
- raw: We have moved from data-poor but fairly predictable settings to data-rich,
    uncertain ones.
- raw: In complex environments, resilience often spells success, while even the most
    brilliantly engineered fixed solutions are often insufficient or counterproductive.
- raw: Robustness is achieved by strengthening parts of the system (the pyramid);
    resilience is the result of linking elements that allow them to reconfigure or
    adapt in response to change or damage (the coral reef).
- raw: We didn’t need every member of the Task Force to know everyone else; we just
    needed everyone to know someone on every team, so that when they thought about,
    or had to work with, the unit that bunked next door or their intelligence counterparts
    in D.C., they envisioned a friendly face rather than a competitive rival. We didn’t
    need everybody to follow every single operation in real time (something just as
    impossible as building lifelong friendships with seven thousand people). We needed
    to enable a team operating in an interdependent environment to understand the
    butterfly-effect ramifications of their work and make them aware of the other
    teams with whom they would have to cooperate in order to achieve strategic—not
    just tactical—success.
- raw: This is the difference between “education” and “training.” Medical school is
    education, first aid is training. Education requires fundamental understanding,
    which can be used to grasp and respond to a nearly infinite variety of threats;
    training involves singular actions, which are useful only against anticipated
    challenges. Education is resilient, training is robust.
- raw: Effective adaptation to emerging threats and opportunities requires the disciplined
    practice of empowered execution. Individuals and teams closest to the problem,
    armed with unprecedented levels of insights from across the network, offer the
    best ability to decide and act decisively.
- raw: In the Task Force, we found that, alongside our new approach to management,
    we had to develop a new paradigm of personal leadership. The role of the senior
    leader was no longer that of controlling puppet master, but rather that of an
    empathetic crafter of culture.
- raw: gardening approach to leadership is anything but passive. The leader acts as
    an “Eyes-On, Hands-Off” enabler who creates and maintains an ecosystem in which
    the organization operates.
