quotes:
- raw: They say hunger is the greatest seasoning. When you’re starving, your brain
    rewards you handsomely for finally eating. Good job, it says, we get to not die
    for a while!
- raw: No one cares about the right thing when they’re hungry.
- raw: 'Cool thing about pendulums: The time it takes for one to swing forward and
    backward—the period—won’t change, no matter how wide it swings. If it’s got a
    lot of energy, it’ll swing farther and faster, but the period will still be the
    same. This is what mechanical clocks take advantage of to keep time. That period
    ends up being driven by two things, and two things only: the length of the pendulum
    and gravity.'
- raw: “They’re wrong!” I crossed my arms. “There’s nothing magical about hydrogen
    and oxygen! They’re required for Earth life, sure. But another planet could have
    completely different conditions. All life needs is a chemical reaction that results
    in copies of the original catalyst. And you don’t need water for that!”
- raw: “Believe it or not, light has momentum,” I said. “It exerts a force. If you
    were out in space and you turned on a flashlight, you’d get a teeny, tiny amount
    of thrust from it.”
- raw: Pathogens evolve slowly over time to attack specific hosts. Astrophage has
    never even been on Earth before. There’s just no way it can ‘infect’ humans.
- raw: “How did you do it? What killed it?” “I penetrated the outer cell membrane
    with a nanosyringe.” “You poked it with a stick?” “No!” I said. “Well. Yes. But
    it was a scientific poke with a very scientific stick.”
- raw: Besides, if I had a nickel for every time I wanted to smack a kid’s parents
    for not teaching them even the most basic things…well…I’d have enough nickels
    to put in a sock and smack those parents with it.
- raw: Planets don’t just reflect light. They also emit it. Everything emits light.
    The temperature of the object defines the wavelength of light emitted. Planets
    are no exception.
- raw: When light hits gas molecules, the electrons get all worked up. Then they calm
    down and re-emit the energy as light. But the frequency of the photons they emit
    is very specific to the molecules involved. Astronomers used this for decades
    to know what gases are out there far, far away. That’s what spectroscopy is all
    about.
- raw: Light is a funny thing. Its wavelength defines what it can and can’t interact
    with. Anything smaller than the wavelength is functionally nonexistent to that
    photon. That’s why there’s a mesh over the window of a microwave. The holes in
    the mesh are too small for microwaves to pass through. But visible light, with
    a much shorter wavelength, can go through freely. So you get to watch your food
    cook without melting your face off.
- raw: Evolution can be insanely effective when you leave it alone for a few billion
    years.
- raw: Oh, right. Relativity. I have no idea how much time it took. Or, rather, I
    have no idea how much time I experienced. When you get going near the speed of
    light, you experience time dilation. More time will have gone by on Earth than
    I have experienced since I left Earth. Relativity is weird.
- raw: As hundreds of astronauts have done before, I place my faith and my life in
    the hands of the engineers who designed the system.
- raw: Their move is taking a long time and I’m getting bored. Wow. I’m sitting here
    in a spaceship in the Tau Ceti system waiting for the intelligent aliens I just
    met to continue our conversation…and I’m bored. Human beings have a remarkable
    ability to accept the abnormal and make it normal.
- raw: 'But the one I’m most interested in is the Fourier transform. It’s the most
    basic tool in sound-wave analysis and arguably the most important. There’s a lot
    of complicated math on how to make it happen, but the end result is this: if you
    run a sound wave through a Fourier transform, it will give you a list of the individual
    notes being played at the same time. So if I played a C-major chord and let this
    app listen to it, the app would tell me there’s a C, an E, and a G. It’s incredibly
    useful.'
- raw: Oh thank God. I can’t imagine explaining “sleep” to someone who had never heard
    of it. Hey, I’m going to fall unconscious and hallucinate for a while. By the
    way, I spend a third of my time doing this. And if I can’t do it for a while,
    I go insane and eventually die. No need for concern.
- raw: Sometimes, the stuff we all hate ends up being the only way to do things.
- raw: Lokken cleared her throat. “I heard there were tornadoes in Europe?”
- raw: '“Oh! Wow. Why did it break off?” He wiggles his carapace. “Not know. Many
    things break. My people make ship very hurry. No time to make sure all things
    work good.” Deadline-induced quality issues: a problem all over the galaxy.'
- raw: leaned to Dimitri. “Are all Russians crazy?” “Yes,” he said with a smile. “It
    is the only way to be Russian and happy at the same time.” “That’s…dark.” “That’s
    Russian!”
- raw: Stupid humanity. Getting in the way of my hobbies.
- raw: We have names for frequency ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum. Then again,
    my students all have eyes and they were still amazed when I told them “x-rays,”
    “microwaves,” “Wi-Fi,” and “purple” were all just wavelengths of light.
- raw: Eridians don’t know about relativistic physics. They calculated their entire
    journey with Newtonian physics. They worked it all out by assuming they could
    just accelerate faster and faster and the speed of light wasn’t an issue. They
    don’t know about time dilation. Rocky doesn’t realize that Erid experienced a
    whole bunch more time than he did on that trip. They don’t know about length dilation.
    The distance to Tau Ceti will actually increase as you slow down relative to it—even
    if you’re still going toward it.
- raw: My lungs, now full of carbon dioxide, panic. But the adrenaline rush doesn’t
    give me the strength I need to escape. It just keeps me awake so I can experience
    death in more detail. Thanks, adrenal glands.
- raw: “Math is not thinking. Math is procedure. Memory is not thinking. Memory is
    storage. Thinking is thinking. Problem, solution. You and me think same speed.
    Why, question?”
- raw: “First I have to wait for my computer to wake up.” “Hurry.” “Okay, I’ll wait
    faster.” “Sarcasm.”
- raw: Seems odd that a species could invent interstellar travel before inventing
    the transistor, but hey, Earth invented nuclear power, television, and even did
    several space launches before the transistor.
- raw: “It’s not a perfect system, though,” I say. “Antibiotics work very well at
    first, but then over the years, they become less and less effective. Eventually
    they barely work at all.” “Why, question?” “Diseases change. Antibiotics kill
    almost all the disease in the body, but some survive. By using antibiotics, humans
    are accidentally teaching diseases how to survive those antibiotics.”
- raw: When you think in base six, arbitrarily adding six to things is normal.
- raw: I spend a lot of time un-suiciding this suicide mission.
- raw: This outfit would severely limit Rocky’s ability to move freely, but hey, fashion
    isn’t about comfort or convenience.
