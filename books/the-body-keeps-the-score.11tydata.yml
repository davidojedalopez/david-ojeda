quotes:
- raw: Trauma, by definition, is unbearable and intolerable.
- raw: Trauma, whether it is the result of something done to you or something you
    yourself have done, almost always makes it difficult to engage in intimate relationships.
- raw: 'This experience, and others like it, helped me formulate this rule for my
    students: If you do something to a patient that you would not do to your friends
    or children, consider whether you are unwittingly replicating a trauma from the
    patient’s past.'
- raw: traumatized people keep secreting large amounts of stress hormones long after
    the actual danger has passed,
- raw: Many traumatized people seem to seek out experiences that would repel most
    of us,14 and patients often complain about a vague sense of emptiness and boredom
    when they are not angry, under duress, or involved in some dangerous activity.
- raw: At this point, just as with drug addiction, we start to crave the activity
    and experience withdrawal when it’s not available. In the long run people become
    more preoccupied with the pain of withdrawal than the activity itself. This theory
    could explain why some people hire someone to beat them, or burn themselves with
    cigarettes. or why they are only attracted to people who hurt them. Fear and aversion,
    in some perverse way, can be transformed into pleasure.
- raw: The theory that mental illness is caused primarily by chemical imbalances in
    the brain that can be corrected by specific drugs has become broadly accepted,
    by the media and the public as well as by the medical profession.
