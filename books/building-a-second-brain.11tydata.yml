quotes:
- raw: The solution is to keep only what resonates in a trusted place that you control,
    and to leave the rest aside. When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive
    level. Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive,
    interesting, or potentially useful. Don’t make it an analytical decision, and
    don’t worry about why exactly it resonates—just look inside for a feeling of pleasure,
    curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it’s time
    to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.
- raw: The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to
    the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in
    terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of
    my current projects?”
- raw: Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as
    possible for my future self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words
    and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what
    exactly caught your attention. Your notes will be useless if you can’t decipher
    them in the future, or if they’re so long that you don’t even try. Think of yourself
    not just as a taker of notes, but as a giver of notes—you are giving your future
    self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand.
- raw: I’m here to tell you that that is no way to live your life. Information becomes
    knowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use. You gain confidence
    in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it’s just a theory.
    This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible
    from consuming to creating.
- raw: 'Capture Criteria #1: Does It Inspire Me?'
- raw: 'Capture Criteria #2: Is It Useful?'
- raw: 'Capture Criteria #3: Is It Personal?'
- raw: 'Capture Criteria #4: Is It Surprising?'
- raw: If what you’re capturing doesn’t change your mind, then what’s the point?
- raw: 'I’ve given you specific criteria to help you decide what is worth capturing,
    but if you take away one thing from this chapter, it should be to keep what resonates.
    Here’s why: making decisions analytically, with a checklist, is taxing and stressful.
    It is the kind of thinking that demands the most energy. When you use up too much
    energy taking notes, you have little left over for the subsequent steps that add
    far more value: making connections, imagining possibilities, formulating theories,
    and creating new ideas of your own.'
- raw: Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original
    in your work. —Gustave Flaubert, French novelist
- raw: 'There’s a name for this phenomenon: the Cathedral Effect.2 Studies have shown
    that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When
    we are in a space with high ceilings, for example—think of the lofty architecture
    of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven—we tend to think in more abstract
    ways. When we’re in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we’re
    more likely to think concretely.'
- raw: 'I eventually named this organizing system PARA,* which stands for the four
    main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.
    These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information, from
    any source, in any format, for any purpose.†'
- raw: 'The temptation when initially capturing notes is to also try to decide where
    they should go and what they mean. Here’s the problem: the moment you first capture
    an idea is the worst time to try to decide what it relates to. First, because
    you’ve just encountered it and haven’t had any time to ponder its ultimate purpose,
    but more importantly, because forcing yourself to make decisions every time you
    capture something adds a lot of friction to the process. This makes the experience
    mentally taxing and thus less likely to happen in the first place.'
- raw: Instead of organizing ideas according to where they come from, I recommend
    organizing them according to where they are going—specifically, the outcomes that
    they can help you realize.
- raw: Using PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put things in.
    It is about identifying the structure of your work and life—what you are committed
    to, what you want to change, and where you want to go.
- raw: 'When you initially capture a note, you may have only seconds to get it into
    your Second Brain before the next meeting, urgent task, or crying child comes
    calling. Not nearly enough time to fully understand what it means or how it might
    be used. When you first capture them, your notes are like unfinished pieces of
    raw material. They require a bit more refinement to turn them into truly valuable
    knowledge assets, like a chemist distilling only the purest compound. This is
    why we separate capturing and organizing from the subsequent steps: you need to
    be able to store something quickly and save any future refinement for later.'
- raw: Distillation is at the very heart of all effective communication. The more
    important it is that your audience hear and take action on your message, the more
    distilled that message needs to be. The details and subtleties can come later
    once you have your audience’s attention.
- raw: Progressive Summarization helps you focus on the content and the presentation
    of your notes,* instead of spending too much time on labeling, tagging, linking,
    or other advanced features offered by many information management tools. It gives
    you a practical, easy thing to do that adds value even when you don’t have the
    energy for more challenging tasks. Most importantly, it keeps your attention on
    the substance of what you’re reading or learning, which is what matters in the
    long term.
- raw: The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should
    make it a little more discoverable for your future self*—by adding a highlight,
    a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to
    information—leave it better than you found it. This ensures that the notes you
    interact with most often will naturally become the most discoverable in a virtuous
    cycle.
- raw: '* I like to think of layer one as the “soil”—an excerpt from a source or my
    own thinking (whether as words, drawings, images, or audio) I initially capture
    into my notes. They are like the ground on which my understanding will be built.
    Layer two is “oil,” as in “I’ve struck oil!,” conveniently represented by black,
    bolded text. Layer three is “gold,” which is even more valuable, and shines in
    highlighter yellow in many apps. Layer four is the “gems,” the most rare and illuminating
    finds that I’ve distilled in my own words as an executive summary.'
- raw: As knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource. The
    creative process is fueled by attention at every step. It is the lens that allows
    us to make sense of what’s happening, to notice what resources we have at our
    disposal, and to see the contribution we can make. The ability to intentionally
    and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted
    world.
- raw: 'This inherent unpredictability means that there is no single, perfectly reliable
    retrieval system for the ideas contained in your notes. Instead, there are four
    methods for retrieval that overlap and complement one another. Together they are
    more powerful than any computer yet more flexible than any human mind. You can
    step through them in order until you find what you’re looking for. Those four
    retrieval methods are: Search Browsing Tags Serendipity'
- raw: Creative expression isn’t always about self-promotion or advancing our own
    career. Some of our most beautiful, creative acts are ones in which we connect
    the dots for others in ways they wouldn’t be able to do themselves.
- raw: Don’t take the work of others wholesale; borrow aspects or parts of their work.
    The shape of a banner on a web page, the layout of a slide, the style of a song—these
    are like the ingredients you put in a blender before hitting the button and mixing
    it into your own recipe. Of course, cite all your sources and influences, even
    if you don’t strictly have to.
- raw: 'My favorite quote about creativity is from the eighteenth-century philosopher
    Giambattista Vico: Verum ipsum factum. Translated to English, it means “We only
    know what we make.” To truly “know” something, it’s not enough to read about it
    in a book. Ideas are merely thoughts until you put them into action. Thoughts
    are fleeting, quickly fading as time passes. To truly make an idea stick, you
    have to engage with it. You have to get your hands dirty and apply that knowledge
    to a practical problem. We learn by making concrete things—before we feel ready,
    before we have it completely figured out, and before we know where it’s going.'
- raw: Building a Second Brain is really about standardizing the way we work, because
    we only really improve when we standardize the way we do something. To get stronger,
    you need to lift weights using the correct form. A musician relies on standardized
    notes and time signatures so they don’t have to reinvent the basics from scratch
    every time. To improve your writing, you need to follow the conventions of spelling
    and grammar (even if you decide to break those rules for special effect down the
    road).
- raw: 'An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most
    difficulty performing at the same time: choosing ideas (known as selection) and
    arranging them into a logical flow (known as sequencing). The reason it is so
    difficult to perform these activities simultaneously is they require different
    modes: selection is divergent, requiring an open state of mind that is willing
    to consider any possibility. Sequencing is convergent, requiring a more closed
    state of mind focused only on the material you already have in front of you.'
- raw: Your business won’t last long if you turn customers away because you’re “maintaining
    your systems.” It’s difficult to find the time to put the world on hold and catch
    your breath. We tend to notice our systems need maintenance only when they break
    down, which we then blame on our lack of self-discipline or our failure to be
    sufficiently productive.
- raw: 'This is where the Project Kickoff Checklist comes in. Here’s my own checklist:
    Capture my current thinking on the project. Review folders (or tags) that might
    contain relevant notes. Search for related terms across all folders. Move (or
    tag) relevant notes to the project folder. Create an outline of collected notes
    and plan the project.'
- raw: 'Here are some questions I use to prompt this initial brainstorm: What do I
    already know about this project? What don’t I know that I need to find out? What
    is my goal or intention? Who can I talk to who might provide insights? What can
    I read or listen to for relevant ideas?'
- raw: It’s tremendously comforting to know that I don’t need to make constant progress
    on everything all the time.
- raw: The purpose of knowledge is to be shared. What’s the point of knowing something
    if it doesn’t positively impact anyone, not even yourself? Learning shouldn’t
    be about hoarding stockpiles of knowledge like gold coins. Knowledge is the only
    resource that gets better and more valuable the more it multiplies.
- raw: When you encounter an idea that resonates with you, it is because that idea
    reflects back to you something that is already within you. Every external idea
    is like a mirror, surfacing within us the truths and the stories that want to
    be told.
- raw: 'I discovered something through that experience: that self-expression is a
    fundamental human need. Self-expression is as vital to our survival as food or
    shelter. We must be able to share the stories of our lives—from the small moments
    of what happened today at school to our grandest theories of what life is about.'
