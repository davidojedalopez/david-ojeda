quotes:
- raw: like to say, “Experience is what you got when you didn’t get what you wanted.”
- raw: 'Good times teach only bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its
    secrets, and that you needn’t worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are
    learned in tough times.'
- raw: 'In my view, that’s the definition of successful investing: doing better than
    the market and other investors.'
- raw: You can’t do the same things others do and expect to outperform.
- raw: In theory there’s no difference between theory and practice, but in practice
    there is.
- raw: “Being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.”
- raw: Individual investors need to think of this “most important” point with every
    investment decision. No matter how good an investment sounds, if price has not
    yet been considered, you can’t know if it is a good investment.
- raw: If your estimate of intrinsic value is correct, over time an asset’s price
    should converge with its value.
- raw: Believe me, there’s nothing better than buying from someone who has to sell
    regardless of price during a crash. Many of the best buys we’ve ever made occurred
    for that reason.
- raw: Since buying from a forced seller is the best thing in our world, being a forced
    seller is the worst. That means it’s essential to arrange your affairs so you’ll
    be able to hold on—and not sell—at the worst of times.
- raw: Over the years leverage has been associated with high returns, but also with
    the most spectacular meltdowns and crashes.
- raw: “The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”
- raw: 'Riskier investments are those for which the outcome is less certain. That
    is, the probability distribution of returns is wider. When priced fairly, riskier
    investments should entail: •    higher expected returns, •    the possibility
    of lower returns, and •    in some cases the possibility of losses.'
- raw: Rather than volatility, I think people decline to make investments primarily
    because they’re worried about a loss of capital or an unacceptably low return.
    To me, “I need more upside potential because I’m afraid I could lose money” makes
    an awful lot more sense than “I need more upside potential because I’m afraid
    the price may fluctuate.” No, I’m sure “risk” is—first and foremost—the likelihood
    of losing money.
- raw: “the relation between different kinds of investments and the risk of loss is
    entirely too indefinite, and too variable with changing conditions, to permit
    of sound mathematical formulation.”
- raw: “Risk means more things can happen than will happen.”
- raw: “There’s a big difference between probability and outcome. Probable things
    fail to happen—and improbable things happen—all the time.” That’s one of the most
    important things you can know about investment risk.
- raw: 'Understanding uncertainty: Investing requires us to make decisions about the
    future. Usually we do so by assuming it will bear a resemblance to the past. But
    that’s far from saying outcomes will be distributed the same as always. Unusual
    and unlikely things can happen, and outcomes can occur in runs (and go to extremes)
    that are hard to predict. Underestimating uncertainty and its consequences is
    a big contributor to investor difficulty.'
- raw: The received wisdom is that risk increases in the recessions and falls in booms.
    In contrast, it may be more helpful to think of risk as increasing during upswings,
    as financial imbalances build up, and materializing in recessions.
- raw: Risk means uncertainty about which outcome will occur and about the possibility
    of loss when the unfavorable ones do.
- raw: 'HOWARD MARKS: The riskiest things: The greatest risk doesn’t come from low
    quality or high volatility. It comes from paying prices that are too high. This
    isn’t a theoretical risk; it’s very real.'
- raw: 'CHRISTOPHER DAVIS: That is, high price both increases risk and lowers returns.'
- raw: 'CHRISTOPHER DAVIS: A good analogy to this is the studies that show there are
    more traffic fatalities among drivers and passengers in SUVs than in compact cars
    despite SUVs’ being bigger and more sturdily built. Drivers of SUVs believe they’re
    not at risk in case of an accident, and this leads to riskier driving. The feeling
    of safety tends to increase risk while the awareness of risk tends to reduce it.'
- raw: Risk cannot be eliminated; it just gets transferred and spread.
- raw: The investment thought process is a chain in which each investment sets the
    requirement for the next.
- raw: Risk arises as investor behavior alters the market. Investors bid up assets,
    accelerating into the present appreciation that otherwise would have occurred
    in the future, and thus lowering prospective returns. And as their psychology
    strengthens and they become bolder and less worried, investors cease to demand
    adequate risk premiums. The ultimate irony lies in the fact that the reward for
    taking incremental risk shrinks as more people move to take it.
- raw: When everyone believes something is risky, their unwillingness to buy usually
    reduces its price to the point where it’s not risky at all. Broadly negative opinion
    can make it the least risky thing, since all optimism has been driven out of its
    price.
- raw: This paradox exists because most investors think quality, as opposed to price,
    is the determinant of whether something’s risky.
- raw: risk control can be present in good times, but it isn’t observable because
    it’s not tested. Ergo, there are no awards. Only a skilled and sophisticated observer
    can look at a portfolio in good times and divine whether it is a low-risk portfolio
    or a high-risk portfolio.
- raw: 'Bottom line: risk control is invisible in good times but still essential,
    since good times can so easily turn into bad times.'
- raw: I’ve said for years that risky assets can make for good investments if they’re
    cheap enough.
- raw: 'there are two concepts we can hold to with confidence:   •   Rule number one:
    most things will prove to be cyclical. •   Rule number two: some of the greatest
    opportunities for gain and loss come when other people forget rule number one.'
- raw: when people are involved, the results are variable and cyclical. The main reason
    for this, I think, is that people are emotional and inconsistent, not steady and
    clinical.
- raw: As The Economist said earlier this year, “the worst loans are made at the best
    of times.”
- raw: Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which produces
    large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends prosperity, and on
    and on.
- raw: In the end, trees don’t grow to the sky, and few things go to zero. Rather,
    most phenomena turn out to be cyclical.
- raw: When things are going well and prices are high, investors rush to buy, forgetting
    all prudence. Then, when there’s chaos all around and assets are on the bargain
    counter, they lose all willingness to bear risk and rush to sell. And it will
    ever be so.
- raw: When investors in general are too risk-tolerant, security prices can embody
    more risk than they do return. When investors are too risk-averse, prices can
    offer more return than risk.
- raw: The swing back from the extreme is usually more rapid—and thus takes much less
    time—than the swing to the extreme. (Or as my partner Sheldon Stone likes to say,
    “The air goes out of the balloon much faster than it went in.”)
- raw: 'Time and time again, the postmortems of financial debacles include two classic
    phrases: “It was too good to be true” and “What were they thinking?”'
- raw: Thus, a hugely profitable investment that doesn’t begin with discomfort is
    usually an oxymoron.
- raw: The process of intelligently building a portfolio consists of buying the best
    investments, making room for them by selling lesser ones, and staying clear of
    the worst. The raw materials for the process consist of (a) a list of potential
    investments, (b) estimates of their intrinsic value, (c) a sense for how their
    prices compare with their intrinsic value, and (d) an understanding of the risks
    involved in each, and of the effect their inclusion would have on the portfolio
    being assembled.
- raw: “investment is the discipline of relative selection.”
- raw: A high-quality asset can constitute a good or bad buy, and a low-quality asset
    can constitute a good or bad buy. The tendency to mistake objective merit for
    investment opportunity, and the failure to distinguish between good assets and
    good buys, get most investors into trouble.
- raw: 'There isn’t always a pendulum or cycle extreme to bet against. Sometimes greed
    and fear, optimism and pessimism, and credulousness and skepticism are balanced,
    and thus clear mistakes aren’t being made. Rather than obviously overpriced or
    underpriced, most things may seem roughly fairly priced. In that case, there may
    not be great bargains to buy or compelling sales to make. JOEL GREENBLATT: This
    is one of the hardest things to master for professional investors: coming in each
    day for work and doing nothing.'
- raw: 'there are products that can’t be differentiated, and economists call them
    “commodities.” They’re goods where no seller’s offering is much different from
    any other. They tend to trade on price alone, and each buyer is likely to take
    the offering at the lowest delivered price. Thus, if you deal in a commodity and
    want to sell more of it, there’s generally one way to do so: cut your price.'
- raw: 'PAUL JOHNSON: I feel strongly that running through this checklist twice a
    year would allow an investor to keep tabs on the swing of the market’s pendulum.
    After a decade, the investor would have a rich database of past market swings
    from which to draw. I wish I had started such a list ten years ago.'
- raw: the quality of a decision is not determined by the outcome. The events that
    transpire afterward make decisions successful or unsuccessful, and those events
    are often well beyond anticipating.
- raw: In the long run, there’s no reasonable alternative to believing that good decisions
    will lead to investment profits. In the short run, however, we must be stoic when
    they don’t.
- raw: There are old investors, and there are bold investors, but there are no old
    bold investors.
- raw: In other words, in amateur tennis, points aren’t won; they’re lost. I recognized
    in Ramo’s loss-avoidance strategy the version of tennis I try to play.
