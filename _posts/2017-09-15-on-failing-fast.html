<p>This post is a personal experience that is, by no means, pleasant to me. But it can help you in every aspect of your life, as it is doing for mine.</p>

<p>Many times in my life I have been reluctant to quiting stuff. Be it a project, a book, a relationship, damn, even a TV series. If I started something, I had to push it as far as humanly possible to get to the finish line. This may seem like a winner attitude, but many times, far more than you can imagine, is quite the opposite.</p>

<h2>So, here comes my story...</h2>

<p>As the fields of Artifiial Inteligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) started to explode all over the place, the software community was quickly looking for innovative ways to implement these technologies into their products. Hell, many times customers were already expecting AI and ML as a given feature on many products and services; even Google changed from a 'mobile-first' to an 'AI-first' approach. So, there was something going on there, and I could not miss it.</p>

<p>I started my research to come up with the best resources to learn ML. I ended up going with the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree since I had already finished a Nanodegree with them, and was happy enough with the results. So, three reasons came to my mind to decide to embark on this journey: 1) I have found a reliable learning source; 2) it is a skill which demand is dramatically increasing lately; and 3) I am not any good at probabilty and statistics, thus I saw this challenge as a way to finally learn them and become a pro. <strong>Bad idea.</strong></p>

<p>Fast forward one year (that is a couple of days ago from this post), I just decided to quit the Nanodegree with just two projects left for graduation. I could not do it anymore. I consider myself someone that has a high ability to learn things fast, and understand the core of things. But, hell, probability and statistics are still my Achilles heel.</p>

<p>I was really struggling from the very beginning, until the day I decided to quit. And not just struggling, I may go as far as say I was in pain. Every time I sat there to study and try to understand what was going on, only thing I got was a headache that lasted the rest of the day. So, why continue with it? Because I was so frustrated and scared to fail. How can I not be smart enough to go through this? If someone else can, so do I. Those were my thoughts.</p>

<p>I later realized that even if I had finished the whole Nanodegree and got my diploma, I would not even want to work on something related, again, in my entire life. So, why bother finishing something just for the sake of doing so? Just to show myself that I can do whatever I wanted to?</p>
