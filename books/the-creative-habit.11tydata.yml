quotes:
- raw: There’s a paradox in the notion that creativity should be a habit. We think
    of creativity as a way of keeping everything fresh and new, while habit implies
    routine and repetition. That paradox intrigues me because it occupies the place
    where creativity and skill rub up against each other.
- raw: Another thing about knowing who you are is that you know what you should not
    be doing, which can save you a lot of heartaches and false starts if you catch
    it early on.
- raw: I often think of myself as water flowing into a rock. The water eventually
    finds its way out the other side, but in between it seeks out every hole and channel
    in the rock. It keeps trickling forward, gathering force until it bursts out on
    the other side as a raging torrent.
- raw: 'If there’s a lesson here it’s: get busy copying. That’s not a popular notion
    today, not when we are all instructed to find our own way, admonished to be original
    and find our own voice at all costs! But it’s sound advice.'
- raw: There’s a difference between a work’s beginning and starting to work.
- raw: Gathering chaos into a satisfying order is a daunting challenge. You have to
    train for this struggle.
- raw: 'You can give yourself the same kind of challenge whatever medium you work
    in: paint only in shades of green; write a story without using the verb “to be”;
    film a ten-minute scene nonstop with one camera. Giving yourself a handicap to
    overcome will force you to think in a new and slightly different way, which is
    the prime goal of scratching.'
- raw: 'Transforming your ideas rarely goes according to plan. This, to me, is the
    most interesting paradox of creativity: In order to be habitually creative, you
    have to know how to prepare to be creative, but good planning alone won’t make
    your efforts successful; it’s only after you let go of your plans that you can
    breathe life into your efforts.'
- raw: The key words here are “prepared” and “lucky.” They’re inseparable. You don’t
    get lucky without preparation, and there’s no sense in being prepared if you’re
    not open to the possibility of a glorious accident.
- raw: Whom the gods wish to destroy, they give unlimited resources.
- raw: “Why do I have to obey the rules?” “Why can’t I be different?” “Why can’t I
    do it my way?” These are the impulses that guide all creative people whether they
    admit it or not. Every act of creation is also an act of destruction or abandonment.
    Something has to be cast aside to make way for the new.
- raw: I know writers who say they take little pleasure in writing but they love having
    written.
- raw: 'You may wonder which came first: the skill or the hard work. But that’s a
    moot point. The Zen master cleans his own studio. So should you.'
- raw: The golfer Davis Love III was taught by his father to think of practice as
    a huge circle, like a clock. You work on a skill until you master it, and then
    you move on to the next one. When you’ve mastered that, you move on to the next,
    and the next, and the next, and eventually you’ll come full circle to the task
    that you began with, which will now need remedial work because of all the time
    you’ve spent on other things.
- raw: Take away a skill, a vital one. Would you still be able to create? How would
    you overcome the loss? How would you compensate? What skill would come to the
    fore to rescue your work?
- raw: A rut can be the consequence of a bad idea. You shouldn’t have started the
    project in the first place.
- raw: A rut can be the end product of bad timing. For some reason you are out of
    sync with the world. You can have the brightest vision with the most mind-blowing
    idea, but if the world isn’t ready for it you can spin your wheels for years.
- raw: A rut can form because of bad luck or circumstances conspiring against you.
- raw: More often than not, I’ve found, a rut is the consequence of sticking to tried
    and tested methods that don’t take into account how you or the world has changed.
    It’s like your mother serving you the same breakfast you loved as a child. You
    push the meal away half-eaten and she says, “But you always loved Cocoa Puffs
    and pork sausage.” That was then, this is now.
- raw: You may be humming along with your novel, writing every day, and then twelve
    months later you find you have four hundred pages that do not make sense. You
    have to make a habit of reviewing your efforts along the way, seeing where you’ve
    been and where you are to make sure you’re still heading in the right direction,
    if any.
- raw: 'I’ll go backstage and come back with a found object. The last time I did this
    I returned with a wooden stool. Then I gave the audience a challenge: You’ve got
    two minutes to come up with sixty uses for the stool. A lot of interesting things
    happen when you set an aggressive quota, even with ideas. People’s competitive
    juices are stirred. Instead of panicking they focus, and with that comes an increased
    fluency and agility of mind. People are also forced to suspend critical thinking.
    To meet the quota, they put their internal critic on hold and let everything out.
    They’re no longer choking off good impulses. The most interesting thing I’ve noticed
    is that there’s a consistent order to the quality of ideas. You’d think the sixtieth
    idea would be the most lame, but for my purposes, which are to trigger leaps of
    imagination, it’s often the opposite.'
- raw: Ernest Hemingway had the nifty trick of always calling it a day at a point
    when he knew what came next. He built himself a bridge to the next day.
- raw: Jerome Robbins liked to say that you do your best work after your biggest disasters.
- raw: Duke University basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski banned his teams from calling
    themselves the “defending national champions,” because he felt this made them
    think defensively. Also, he argued that you only defend something that can be
    taken away from you, and your past successes will always be yours no matter what.)
- raw: (Remember the centenarian who when asked about the best part of living such
    a long life replied, “No more peer pressure.”)
