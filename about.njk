  <h1>Hey, it's me again</h1>

  <p>I enjoy many things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Training and playing with my dogs.</strong> I have two Border
        Collies, Nina and Alyx. Having them and making sure they behave
        appropiately is a full-time job. And I love it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Writing.</strong> Mainly about personal finance, investments and
        personal development, but also about technology and life journaling.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Reading.</strong> In order to learn and write better, I also need
        to read a lot. My favorite genres are sci-fi and personal development.

        for more details.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Playing videogames.</strong> They have been an important time of
        my live, and I believe they will continue to be in the long future.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Teaching.</strong> I do so mainly in the form of writing, but also
        in 1:1 conversations. I teach and share my knowledge around money and
        investments to mexican people, and about technology to anyone who wants
        it.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My core values</h2>
  <p>
    There are plenty of things that change over time, but my core values do not.
    These values are what drive all my decisions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Family.</strong> My family is paramount. If something's gonna harm
        my relationship with my family, then I won't do it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Privacy.</strong> I'm against using people's data to drive
        revenue. That's reflected throughout my whole lifestyle. I don't support
        any of Facebook's companies. I don't have Instagram. I don't use Google
        Search. I don't use Chrome. I don't use Gmail. Is it troublesome and
        impractical most of the time? Yes. But that's the path I decided to take,
        and you can do as you please.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some conflicts with privacy and family tho. I can't completely
        leave WhatsApp because that's where most of my family hangs around; and
        that's the most used messaging platform in Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, by the way, <strong>this site doesn't track you at all</strong>. I
        don't even know how many people visit it, and I don't care.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Money.</strong> The amount of money is rarely the driver of my
        decisions right now. I have a good insight on how much is enough. So, if I
        need to trade freedom and flexibility for money, I'd probably not do it.
        If a decision is likely to help me sleep better at night, then I'll take
        it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Meaningful work.</strong> Sounds like clich√©, but working in
        something I love and enjoy makes a big difference in my life. Especially
        if it's something I'm a user of.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point in my life I wouldn't switch jobs for money or status, I'd
        do it only for more meaningful work.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My timeline</h2>
  {% for year, months in timeline | dictsort | reverse %}
    <h3>{{ year }}</h3>
    <ul>
      {% for month, events in months %}
        <h4>{{ month }}</h4>
        {% for event in events %}
          <li>
            {% if event.link %}
              <a href="{{ event.link }}">{{ event.title }}</a>
            {% else %} 
              <p>{{ event.title }}</p> 
            {% endif %}            
          </li>  
        {% endfor %}        
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endfor %}
