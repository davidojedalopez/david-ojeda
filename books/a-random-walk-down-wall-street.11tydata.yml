quotes:
- raw: In an efficient market, there are no possibilities for earning extraordinary
    gains without taking on extraordinary risks.
- raw: GREED RUN AMOK has been an essential feature of every spectacular boom in history.
    In their frenzy, market participants ignore firm foundations of value for the
    dubious but thrilling assumption that they can make a killing by building castles
    in the air.
- raw: Tuesday, October 29, 1929, was among the most catastrophic days in the history
    of the New York Stock Exchange. Only October 19 and 20, 1987, rivaled in intensity
    the panic on the exchange. More than 16.4 million shares were traded on that day
    in 1929. (A 16-million-share day in 1929 would be equivalent to a multibillion-share
    day today because of the greater number of listed shares.)
- raw: This system fundamentally changed in the early 2000s to what might be called
    the “originate and distribute” model of banking. Mortgage loans were still made
    by banks (as well as by big specialized mortgage companies). But the loans were
    held by the originating institution for only a few days, until they could be sold
    to an investment banker. The investment banker would then assemble packages of
    these mortgages and issue mortgage-backed securities—derivative bonds “securitized”
    by the underlying mortgages. These collateralized securities relied on the payments
    of interest and principal from the underlying mortgages to service the interest
    payment on the new mortgage-backed bonds.
- raw: This new system led to looser lending standards by bankers and mortgage companies.
    If the only risk a lender took was the risk that a mortgage loan would go bad
    in the few days before it could be sold to the investment banker, the lender did
    not need to consider the creditworthiness of the borrower.
- raw: Moreover, so-called NINJA loans were common—those were loans to people with
    no income, no job, and no assets. Increasingly, lenders did not even bother to
    ask for documentation about ability to pay. Those were called NO-DOC loans.
- raw: The lesson, however, is not that markets occasionally can be irrational and
    that we should therefore abandon the firm-foundation theory of the pricing of
    financial assets. Rather, the clear conclusion is that, in every case, the market
    did correct itself. The market eventually corrects any irrationality—albeit in
    its own slow, inexorable fashion. Anomalies can crop up, markets can get irrationally
    optimistic, and often they attract unwary investors. But, eventually, true value
    is recognized by the market, and this is the main lesson investors must heed.
- raw: And there is abundant empirical evidence that most day traders lose money.
    It is not hard, really, to make money in the market. As we shall see later, an
    investor who simply buys and holds a broad-based portfolio of stocks can make
    reasonably generous long-run returns. What is hard to avoid is the alluring temptation
    to throw your money away on short, get-rich-quick speculative binges.
- raw: 'We can summarize the discussion thus far by restating the first two rules:
    Look for growth situations with low price-earnings multiples. If the growth takes
    place, there’s often a double bonus—both the earnings and the multiple rise, producing
    large gains. Beware of very high multiple stocks in which future growth is already
    discounted. If growth doesn’t materialize, losses are doubly heavy—both the earnings
    and the multiples drop.'
- raw: Human nature likes order; people find it hard to accept the notion of randomness.
    No matter what the laws of chance might tell us, we search for patterns among
    random events wherever they might occur—not only in the stock market but even
    in interpreting sporting phenomena.
- raw: The psychologists conjecture that the persistent belief in the hot hand could
    be due to memory bias. If long sequences of hits or misses are more memorable
    than alternating sequences, observers are likely to overestimate the correlation
    between successive shots. When events sometimes do come in clusters and streaks,
    people refuse to believe that they are random, even though such clusters and streaks
    do occur frequently in random data such as are derived from the tossing of a coin.
- raw: Financial forecasting appears to be a science that makes astrology look respectable.
- raw: I do not mean to imply that Wall Street analysts are incompetent and simply
    parrot back what managements tell them. But I do imply that the average analyst
    is just that—a well-paid and usually highly intelligent person who has an extraordinarily
    difficult job and does it in a rather mediocre fashion. Analysts are often misguided,
    sometimes sloppy, and susceptible to the same pressures as other people. In short,
    they are very human beings.
- raw: Portfolio theory begins with the premise that all investors are like my wife—they
    are risk-averse. They want high returns and guaranteed outcomes.
- raw: Basically, beta is the numerical description of systematic risk. Despite the
    mathematical manipulations involved, the basic idea behind the beta measurement
    is one of putting some precise numbers on the subjective feelings money managers
    have had for years. The beta calculation is essentially a comparison between the
    movements of an individual stock (or portfolio) and the movements of the market
    as a whole.
- raw: Now, the important thing to realize is that systematic risk cannot be eliminated
    by diversification. It is precisely because all stocks move more or less in tandem
    (a large share of their variability is systematic) that even diversified stock
    portfolios are risky. Indeed, if you diversified perfectly by buying a share in
    a total stock market index (which by definition has a beta of 1), you would still
    have quite variable (risky) returns because the market as a whole fluctuates widely.
- raw: 'Basically, there are four factors that create irrational market behavior:
    overconfidence, biased judgments, herd mentality, and loss aversion.'
- raw: 'Steve Forbes, the longtime publisher of Forbes magazine, liked to quote the
    advice he received at his grandfather’s knee: “It’s far more profitable to sell
    advice than to take it.”'
- raw: As the economic historian Charles Kindleberger has stated, “There is nothing
    so disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.” And
    as Robert Shiller, author of the best-selling Irrational Exuberance, has noted,
    the process feeds on itself in a “positive feedback loop.”
- raw: This illustrated the effect of “framing” as well as risk-seeking preferences
    in the domain of losses. When doctors are faced with decisions regarding treatment
    options for people with cancer, different choices tend to be made if the problem
    is stated in terms of survival probabilities rather than mortality probabilities.
- raw: Charles Ellis, a longtime observer of stock markets and author of the brilliant
    investing book Winning the Loser’s Game, observes that, in the game of amateur
    tennis, most points are won not by adroit plays on your part but rather by mistakes
    on the part of your opponent. So it is in investing.
- raw: Any investment that has become a topic of widespread conversation is likely
    to be hazardous to your wealth. It was true of gold in the early 1980s and Japanese
    real estate and stocks in the late 1980s. It was true of Internet-related stocks
    in the late 1990s and condominiums in California, Nevada, and Florida in the first
    decade of the 2000s, as well as bitcoin, GameStop, and AMC Entertainment in 2021.
- raw: Fidelity’s analysis covered 5.2 million customer accounts from 2011 to 2020.
    They found that female customers earned on average considerably more than their
    male counterparts. The source of women’s superior returns was the way they trade,
    or more accurately, their propensity not to trade. Male Fidelity customers traded
    twice as often as female customers. Vanguard saw similar patterns during the same
    decade. The evidence suggests that trading too much is hazardous to your wealth.
- raw: A “paper loss” is just as real as a realized loss.
- raw: My advice is that you should not buy IPOs at their initial offering price and
    that you should never buy an IPO just after it begins trading at prices that are
    generally higher than the IPO price. Historically, IPOs have been a bad deal.
    In measuring all IPOs five years after their initial issuance, researchers have
    found that IPOs underperform the total stock market by about 4 percentage points
    per year. The poor performance starts about six months after the issue is sold.
    Six months is generally set as the “lock-up” period, where insiders are prohibited
    from selling stock to the public. Once that constraint is lifted, the price of
    the stock often tanks.
- raw: Investors should also never forget the age-old maxim “If something is too good
    to be true, it is too good to be true.”
- raw: James Comey of FBI fame. Comey has said, “I’ve been ‘probed’ in this strange
    field trip through life. I’ve testified in court, I have briefed the president
    of the United States repeatedly, I’ve argued in front of the United States Supreme
    Court, and I’ve been probed at Bridgewater. And Bridgewater is by far the hardest.”
    And for all you can criticize Ray Dalio, Comey said, “he is one smart bastard.”
- raw: If you want a get-rich-quick investment strategy, this is not the book for
    you. I’ll leave that for the snake oil salesmen. You can only get poor quickly.
    To get rich, you will have to do it slowly, and you have to start now.
- raw: The two steps in this exercise—finding your risk level, and identifying your
    tax bracket and income needs—seem obvious. But it is incredible how many people
    go astray by mismatching the types of securities they buy with their risk tolerance
    and their income and tax needs.
- raw: There is no sure and easy road to riches. High returns can be achieved only
    through higher risk-taking (and perhaps through accepting lower liquidity).
- raw: The amount of risk you can tolerate is partly determined by your sleeping point.
- raw: According to Roger Ibbotson, who has spent a lifetime measuring returns from
    alternative portfolios, more than 90 percent of an investor’s total return is
    determined by the asset categories that are selected and their overall proportional
    representation. Less than 10 percent of investment success is determined by the
    specific stocks or mutual funds that an individual chooses.
- raw: The longer the time period over which you can hold on to your investments,
    the greater should be the share of common stocks in your portfolio.
- raw: If possible, keep a small reserve (in a money fund) to take advantage of market
    declines and buy a few extra shares if the market is down sharply.
- raw: Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VGSLX) or Fidelity Real Estate Index Fund (FSRNX)
- raw: TLH is the crown jewel of tax management. It involves selling an investment
    that is trading at a loss and replacing it with a highly correlated but not identical
    investment. Doing so allows you to maintain the risk and return characteristics
    of your portfolio while generating losses that can be used to reduce your current
    taxes.
- raw: Those timeless lessons involve broad diversification, annual rebalancing, using
    index funds, and staying the course.
