quotes:
  - raw:
      Now I understand that many of the things I took for granted are, for many
      people, monumental struggles. Simple things like climbing stairs, putting on clothes,
      even digesting food-for many people these acts require a kind of quiet heroism.
  - raw:
      Not that I kid myself that anyone is ever totally ready for the death of a
      family member. Death, by its nature, is always abrupt. However gradual the process
      leading up to it, there comes a single moment when life ends. That moment can't
      be other than shocking. That's just how it is.

      "I had cancer again. And here's a sorry bit of math: Having cancer twice is way more than twice as bad as having cancer once. Recurrence
      is the disease's war cry, the sure signal that the stakes have been raised to
      nothing less than life or death."
  - raw: Seem reckless, but be prepared. Act crazy, but do your homework.
  - raw:
      Not to digress, but I used to be a real wild man in meetings. I went out of
      my way to remind people that I was not entirely normal or predictable. I drummed
      on boardroom tables. I cracked jokes at entirely inappropriate moments. I threw
      tantrums now and then. I pissed off a lot of people. Others I only confused. But
      I always had a stra»õegy. In every negotiation, every deal, I knew where I wanted
      to end up. Again, I'd planned the landing. That freed me up for all sorts of antics
      with the leap.
